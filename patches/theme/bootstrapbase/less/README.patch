-About bootstrap in Moodle
--------------------------
 If you want to make changes to the .css generated from these .less files then you
 need to use a LESS Compiler. Details on specific compilers and how to install them
 can be found at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/LESS
@@ -12,22 +10,20 @@ the following commands from the "theme/bootstrapbase/less" directory:
 
 For the main Moodle styles:
 
-    recess --compile --compress moodle.less > ../style/moodle.css
+recess --compile --compress moodle.less > ../style/moodle.css
 
 And for the subset of styles of interest to the TinyMCE editor:
 
-    recess --compile --compress editor.less >  ../style/editor.css
+recess --compile --compress editor.less >  ../style/editor.css
 
 You can add --watch to make sure it updates every time you make a change.
 
 If the compilation is failing and you're not getting any useful error message, try using lessc instead i.e.:
 
-    lessc moodle.less
+lessc moodle.less
 
 This is the same tool that's getting called by recess, but the errors seems better if you go direct.
